Issue Queue
-----------

Issue Queue is a Drupal feature (http://drupal.org/project/features)
which creates a single issue queue.

It is modeled on the drupal.org issue queues but intended as a simplified
version for individual use cases
e.g. a site which requires a single issue queue for all issues related
to that site.
